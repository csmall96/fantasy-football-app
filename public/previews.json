Both teams have faced their fair share of injuries and underperforming players, making this matchup a battle of determination and fantasy wits.\n\nsasanassary's lineup features young talent with Jordan Love at QB, Woody Marks and Chase Brown in the RB slots, and a dynamic WR duo of Jaylen Waddle and DK Metcalf.

Look for Jonathan Taylor to have a standout performance and lead BrianKrecicki3 to victory in the final week of the season."
