    "preview": "WEEK 10 MATCHUP PREVIEW\n\nMATCHUP: LaPorta Potty vs BOlivers\n\nThis week, we have a thrilling matchup between cslim's LaPorta Potty and nicarothers's BOlivers. With cslim sitting at 5-4 and nicarothers boasting a 6-3 record, both teams are hungry for a victory to solidify their playoff aspirations.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\n1. D'Andre Swift (LaPorta Potty - RB): Swift has been a consistent force in the LaPorta Potty lineup, showcasing his dual-threat ability as a dynamic runner and pass-catcher. Facing a tough BOlivers defense, Swift will need to deliver a standout performance to lead his team to victory.\n\n2. Bijan Robinson (BOlivers - RB): Robinson has been a fantasy stud this season, displaying his elite skill set as a powerful runner with breakaway speed. He will be a focal point of the BOlivers' offensive game plan against a LaPorta Potty defense that will have their hands full containing his explosiveness.\n\n3. Rome Odunze (LaPorta Potty - WR): Odunze has emerged as a top target for LaPorta Potty, showcasing his big-play ability and reliable hands. With his knack for finding the end zone, Odunze will be a key factor in cslim's aerial attack and will look to exploit any weaknesses in the BOlivers secondary.\n\n4. Quentin Johnston (BOlivers - WR): Johnston has been a consistent playmaker for the BOlivers, using his size and speed to create mismatches against opposing defenses. As a favorite target of QB Drake Maye, Johnston will be a player to watch as he aims to put up big numbers against a LaPorta Potty defense that will have their hands full.\n\nPREDICTION\n\nIn what promises to be a high-scoring affair, both teams boast a talented roster with game-changing players. With the matchup too close to call, it will likely come down to which team executes their game plan more effectively. While cslim's LaPorta Potty has shown resilience throughout the season, nicarothers's BOlivers have the slight edge in terms of overall firepower. Expect a back-and-forth battle, but ultimately, I predict nicarothers's BOlivers to come out on top in a narrow victory over cslim's LaPorta Potty."
