Watch for him to burn defenders and rack up the fantasy points.\n\n**Rico_Suave**\n\n**Bo Nix (QB, Rico_Suave):** Nix may not have the same star power as Mahomes, but he's a gritty quarterback capable of making plays when it counts. Keep an eye on him as he tries to outduel his more heralded counterpart.\n\n**Rhamondre Stevenson (RB, Rico_Suave):** A bruising back with a nose for the end zone, Stevenson is a player to watch in Rico_Suave's backfield.

Watch for him to make dazzling catches and put up big numbers.\n\n**PREDICTION**\n\nIn what promises to be a high-scoring affair, I'm giving the edge to jdepalo6 in this matchup. With Mahomes leading the charge and a solid supporting cast around him, jdepalo6's team is primed for success. While Rico_Suave has some firepower of his own, I predict that jdepalo6 will come out on top thanks to a standout performance from his star-studded lineup. Look for jdepalo6 to remain undefeated and continue his reign atop the standings with a hard-fought victory in Week 4."
