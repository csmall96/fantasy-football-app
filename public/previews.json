Can he continue his hot streak and lead his team to another victory?\n\n* JONATHAN TAYLOR (BrianKrecicki3, RB): Taylor is a fantasy stud and will look to bounce back from a quiet Week 1. Facing a formidable cslim defense, he needs to step up and deliver for his team.\n\n* MIKE EVANS (cslim, WR): Evans is a big-play threat every time he steps on the field. With his size and skill, he could exploit BrianKrecicki3's secondary and put up some serious fantasy points.\n\n* KYLER MURRAY (BrianKrecicki3, QB): Murray is a dual-threat quarterback who can hurt defenses with both his arm and legs. Against cslim's defense, he needs to be at the top of his game to carry his team to victory.\n\n**PREDICTION**\nThis matchup promises to be a high-scoring affair with both teams boasting talent across the board. While cslim has the momentum on their side, BrianKrecicki3's roster is too talented to stay winless for long.

Look for Dak Prescott and Mike Evans to have big games and lead cslim to a 2-0 start to the season."
