On the other side, nicarothers counters with Jayden Daniels and a solid RB trio of Bijan Robinson, David Montgomery, and Kenneth Gainwell.\n\nIn terms of projections, it's a dead heat with both teams currently projected to score 0.0 points. However, we all know projections are just a piece of the puzzle, and anything can happen on any given Sunday.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH:\nFor jcarothers9, keep an eye on Travis Etienne.
