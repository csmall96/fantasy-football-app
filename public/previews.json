With his ability to pass and run, Prescott will be a key player to watch in this matchup.\n\n**Jonathan Taylor (BrianKrecicki3 - RB):** Taylor is one of the premier running backs in the league and will be a focal point of BrianKrecicki3's offense. After a solid Week 1 showing, Taylor will look to exploit cslim's defense and put up big numbers.\n\n**Mark Andrews (cslim - TE):** Andrews is a reliable target for Dak Prescott and is coming off a strong Week 1 performance.

While cslim may have the edge coming off a win, BrianKrecicki3 will be motivated to get their first victory of the season.
