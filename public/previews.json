    "preview": "WEEK 10 MATCHUP PREVIEW\n\nMATCHUP: LaPorta Potty vs BOlivers\n\nIt's going to be a clash of the titans as cslim's LaPorta Potty (5-4) takes on nicarothers's BOlivers (6-3) in Week 10. Both teams are coming in with winning records, so this matchup is crucial for solidifying their positions in the playoff race.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\n1. Caleb Williams (LaPorta Potty - QB): Williams has been a revelation since taking over as the starting quarterback for Oklahoma. His dual-threat ability makes him a nightmare for opposing defenses, and he could put up big numbers against a BOlivers defense that has struggled against mobile quarterbacks.\n\n2. Bijan Robinson (BOlivers - RB): Robinson has been a workhorse for nicarothers all season, consistently putting up solid numbers week in and week out. With a favorable matchup against a LaPorta Potty defense that has shown vulnerability against the run, Robinson could be in for a big game.\n\n3. Jameson Williams (LaPorta Potty - WR): Williams has emerged as one of the top deep threats in college football this season. If he can connect with Williams on a few big plays, it could swing the momentum in LaPorta Potty's favor.\n\nPREDICTION\n\nThis is shaping up to be a high-scoring affair, with both teams boasting explosive offenses. While nicarothers's BOlivers have been more consistent throughout the season, cslim's LaPorta Potty has the potential to pull off the upset if their key players deliver standout performances. In the end, I predict a close game, but I give the slight edge to BOlivers to come out on top in a shootout."

Jalen Hurts (Omarkom1 - QB): Hurts has been a dual-threat dynamo this season, racking up passing and rushing yards at an impressive rate.
