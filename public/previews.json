Facing a favorable matchup against a shaky defense, Prescott could be in line for another big game and lead his team to victory.\n\n2.

Keep an eye on Justin Herbert as well, as he has shown flashes of brilliance and could put up big numbers against a vulnerable defense. On the other side, Omarkom1's Christian McCaffrey is always a player to watch when he's healthy.
