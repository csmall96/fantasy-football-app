    "preview": "WEEK 7 MATCHUP PREVIEW\n\nMATCHUP: LaPorta Potty vs Bourne 2 Ja. Goff\n\nIt's a clash of titans this week as cslim's LaPorta Potty takes on jammorgan18's Bourne 2 Ja. Goff. Both teams are coming off solid performances in Week 6, and they'll look to keep the momentum going in this highly anticipated matchup.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nCaleb Williams (cslim - QB): The rookie quarterback has been turning heads with his dual-threat abilities. Facing a tough defense in Week 7, Williams will need to use his arm and legs to put up points for LaPorta Potty.\n\nKyren Williams (cslim - RB): Williams has been a consistent performer in the running game and as a pass-catcher out of the backfield. Look for him to be a key factor in cslim's offensive strategy.\n\nRashee Rice (cslim - WR): Rice has been a reliable target for Williams, showcasing his route-running and hands. He will be crucial in stretching the field and creating scoring opportunities for LaPorta Potty.\n\nDak Prescott (jammorgan18 - QB): Prescott has been lighting up the fantasy scoreboard with his stellar passing performances. With a favorable matchup in Week 7, expect Prescott to continue his hot streak.\n\nGeorge Kittle (jammorgan18 - TE): Kittle is a matchup nightmare for opposing defenses, using his size and speed to create mismatches. He will be a key target for Prescott in the red zone.\n\nMichael Pittman (jammorgan18 - WR): Pittman has emerged as a top receiving option for the Bourne 2 Ja. Goff squad, showcasing his playmaking ability and reliability. Look for him to make big plays in Week 7.\n\nPREDICTION\n\nIn what promises to be a high-scoring affair, both teams have the talent and firepower to light up the scoreboard. With cslim's dynamic playmakers and jammorgan18's explosive offense, this matchup could come down to the wire. Ultimately, I predict a narrow victory for Bourne 2 Ja. Goff, as Dak Prescott and his arsenal of weapons prove to be too much for LaPorta Potty to handle. Final score: LaPorta Potty 135.5, Bourne 2 Ja. Goff 142.8."
